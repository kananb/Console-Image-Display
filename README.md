## Launch

* Visual C++ 2017
* [OpenCV 3.4.3](https://opencv.org/releases/page/3/)
* WinAPI

To run this program, download the executable from the bin folder or download the source files from the src folder and compile them with the Visual C++ compiler (found in the Windows SDK). If compiling locally, it is necessary to link opencv_world232.lib and include all of the required header files from the OpenCV download.
